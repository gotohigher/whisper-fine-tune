They have teeth that look like bear traps sticking out in all these different directions. And the reason why that happens and doesn't seem to happen in places like this in Africa.
It's because all of our foods are softened, and our meat, our bread is all just soft and palatable, and our teeth don't have a purpose, really. We don't chew! We don't knaw and gristle anymore. And teeth, just like the human spirit, without given a purpose! They just drift!"

We've brought some bottled water to wash it first. It honestly hurt, especially the thorns, but it wasn't as bad as I thought. Some of my tattoos were worse than that! And then what happens now? Do I leave it? Does the ash make the scar develop? We don't really have an instruction manual here."
